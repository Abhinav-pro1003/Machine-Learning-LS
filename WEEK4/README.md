# 🧠 Next Word Predictor using Transformers

Final project for Week 4 of the NLP Course — bringing together classical ML, word embeddings, and transformer models (like GPT-2) for next-word prediction and sentence classification. This project demonstrates practical NLP techniques using real models and interactive deployment via Gradio.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a next-word prediction system using GPT-2
- Compare classical ML (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and embeddings (GloVe)
- Evaluate using accuracy and top-k predictions
- Deploy an interactive interface for users
