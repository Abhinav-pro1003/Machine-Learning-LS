# WEEK2 Completed!!!

I have completed my WEEK2 problems. The solution of problem 1 and 2 are in Problem-1.py and Problem-2.py respectively.
This week I learnt about new modules like gensim and more. Using data from kaggle helped me to take care of random data to be set.

This week was more curious as I learnt more. Looking forward for WEEK3 

Notice: In the Problem-2.py for function def predict_tweet_sentiment(model, glove_model, tweet): I used word2vec_model instead of glove model.
As this week covered only word2vec model, even the step 2 in problem says to import google news word2vec model. Thus I 
guess it would be a typo.
