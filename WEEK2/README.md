# WEEK2 Completed!!!

I have completed my WEEK2 problems. The solution of problem 1 and 2 are in Problem-1.py and Problem-2.py respectively.
This week I learnt about new modules like gensim and more. Using data from kaggle helped me to take care of random data to be set.

This week was more curious as I learnt more. Looking forward for WEEK3
